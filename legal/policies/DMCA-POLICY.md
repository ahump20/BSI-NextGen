## 9. Examples and FAQs

### 9.1 Common Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Photograph Used Without Permission

**Q:** Someone posted my copyrighted photograph on a user profile. What do I do?

**A:** Submit a DMCA takedown notice per Section 3, identifying:
- Your copyrighted photograph (with original publication URL if available)
- The specific URL on our Platform where it appears
- Your contact information and statements required by DMCA

**We will remove the image within 5-7 business days if the notice is valid.**

#### Scenario 2: Statistics Chart or Infographic

**Q:** I created an original statistics infographic and someone copied it. Can I file a DMCA notice?

**A:** Yes, if your infographic contains original creative expression (design, layout, visualizations). Submit a takedown notice identifying:
- Your original infographic (with proof of creation date)
- The infringing copy on our Platform
- Why it infringes (substantial similarity, copying of creative elements)

**Note:** Raw statistics and data are not copyrightable, but creative presentation may be.

#### Scenario 3: Disputed Takedown

**Q:** My content was removed, but I believe I have the right to use it (fair use, license, etc.). What do I do?

**A:** Submit a counter-notification per Section 5. Include:
- Why you believe removal was a mistake (e.g., "I have a license," "It's fair use," "I created it")
- Your consent to jurisdiction and service of process
- Your contact information

**We will forward your counter-notice to the complainant. If they don't sue within 10-14 business days, we'll restore your content.**

### 9.2 Fair Use Considerations

**Fair use (17 U.S.C. § 107) may permit use of copyrighted works without permission for:**

- Criticism, comment, or news reporting
- Scholarship or research
- Transformative uses (parody, commentary)

**Fair use is determined by four factors:**

1. Purpose and character of use (commercial vs. educational, transformative vs. derivative)
2. Nature of copyrighted work (factual vs. creative)
3. Amount used (small excerpt vs. entire work)
4. Effect on market (does use harm copyright owner's market?)

**Fair use is a legal defense, not a right.** Courts determine fair use on a case-by-case basis.

**If you claim fair use:**
- Include detailed explanation in your counter-notification
- Be prepared to defend your use in court if necessary
- Consult an attorney for complex fair use questions
